Decision Card Game Project Summary

Overview:
This is a Flutter-based decision card game with poker-style UI where users swipe cards to answer ethical dilemma questions.

Key Features:
- Swipeable cards with poker-style design
- Four directional answers (♥, ♦, ♣, ♠)
- Smooth animations for card swiping and rotation
- Answer tracking and results evaluation
- Responsive UI with fade-in animations
- Direction-based scoring system

File Structure:
- lib/main.dart: Main app structure and card data
- lib/card_stack.dart: Core card UI and swipe functionality
- lib/card_model.dart: Data models for cards and answers
- lib/results_page.dart: Results evaluation screen

Current Implementation:
- Cards display with poker-style UI and suit symbols
- Swipe gestures with 15-degree rotation
- Answer tracking and final results
- Smooth slide animations and fade-in animations
- Stack management with proper card display

Current Issues:
- Card animation is being fixed but not fully visible
- The swipe animation is not being properly applied
- Card disappears immediately but is being tracked
- The animation is being tracked but not being played

The app is working with proper functionality, but there are still issues with the animation that make the animation not being visible.

The next fix is to make the animation to make the animation more visible.
